\description{
Fitting MLP-C model to the EUPPBench datasets' visibility forecasts.
Architecture: 2 hidden layers (25x25 neurons), Activation function: Logistic
Input features:
\itemize{
\item control forecast (normalized)
\item ensemble mean (normalized)
\item ensemble variance (normalized)
\item proportions of forecasts predicting visibility between 0 and 1000 meters
\item proportions of forecasts predicting visibility between 1001 and 2000 meters
\item proportions of forecasts predicting visibility above 30000 meters
